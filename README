Hello! How are you?
This repo is for you.
So I pushed the pivot project as a tar file
If you installed pivot module on your local, you have to unzip this file and then cd in this pivot folder.
In your terminal window, ./bin/pivot --config --config-wiki-sample.yaml
After it, you can call at localhost:portnum in your browser.
This projects used the drag and drop function in order to zoom in chart
I hope it will help you to decide your final decision.
Best regards.
Leonid.
